The Global Surface Water Explorer is a simple web-mapping tool that shows all of the water datasets and allows users to navigate the globe 
visualizing the water datasets without installing any software. It also allows users to view the complete history of water detections over 
the 35-year period by clicking on the map. The tool is intended as a data viewer and does not provide any analytical features - if you 
would like to do your own analysis on the data then access the data using Data Download or Google Earth Engine.
